      <description>The reasons seems to be obvious, the new privacy policy.
Am I also part of the herd? Is it because everyone seems to be moving to it? Na I have been using signal for quite a time now but I mostly used it for saving notes to self, since nobody else seemed to use it. Even if you are trying it out just because Elon Musk tweeted &amp;ldquo;Use Signal&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s fine, Signal is worth it.</description>
