      <description>Backstory I was working on a project in go where I had to open and play around with too many files at once ( around 50 thousand ). The program ran fine when I was working with one file at a time. But when I tried to make it concurrent, I had an error saying Too many open files.
Now that&amp;rsquo;s weird cause my hardware wasn&amp;rsquo;t the bottleneck, I had enough free ram, my CPU wasn&amp;rsquo;t maxed out and I had plenty of empty storage.</description>
